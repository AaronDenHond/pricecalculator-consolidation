# pricecalculator-consolidation
Trying the group exercise by myself to make sure I learn whatever I may have missed as a group.

The Mission

Today you are going to combine your new awesome OOP powers with a database. To give you some time to get familiar with a database, this exercise only requires read access, not write access.

Make a price calculator with the following entities:

    Customer (Firstname, Lastname)
    A customer group (Name)
    A product (product name, price in cents)


Plan of attack :

1. Make the basic MVC structure, use the MVC boilerplate as a guidance

check

2. Focus on the Model first : classes

in progress

3. Connection to the database in the Model

in progress?
